Adding history classes to their course list will definitely **wear out their enthusiasm** and make them less productive, leading to worse overall academic performance. **This point is best illustrated by the example of my roommate**. He is forced to take an extra history class while having to attend 13 classes on nuclear physics. Every day he wakes up before the sun rises and come back to the dormitory after midnight. He can’t help dozing off during classes and therefore have to spend more time to catch up after class. This **vicious circle** makes him exhausted and unable to concentrate, and he is inevitably in poor physical conditions and getting lower scores in tests and exams.
   3. para3
      1. Students majoring in sciences and engineering
      2. History classed should not be compulsory to all the **students of sciences（注意复数） and engineering**. Tsinghua University is a good case in point. Tsinghua University **is devoted in nurturing STEM talents**, which is lacking in history professors. It will undoubtedly impose an extra financial burden if it has to provide history classes to the huge amount of students of sciences and engineering, because the education quality cannot be ensured unless the University hire numerous **high-paying talents** in History. **The financial burden will probably be reflected in student’s tuition, and that may cause widespread complaints**.(老师建议不举例直接说这一类的学校)

   3.  试写
       1.  主要分论点（主旨+道理+例子，最好是个例+总结） Firstly, time devoted to science and technology is **rewarding in terms of** future career development. For example, when students enroll in programming classes, they get to improve their digital proficiency and ways of thinking. Thus, they gain a competitive edge in landing a job. This point is best illustrated by the case of my uncle, Jason. When he was a freshman in Tsinghua University, he enrolled in a great many selective courses in Computer Science and Engineering. Additionally, he put much effort into learning practical computer skills from available online resources and completed dozens of highly-rated projects on Github. Finding a job after graduation was fairly easy for him, and all the interviewers were impressed by his **expertise in solving** complex problems with beautiful codes. He was accepted by McKinsey as a data scientist and developed an excellent career in data analyzing afterwards.
       2. 次要分论点（主旨+道理+数例/名人名言+总结） Secondly, putting effort into acquiring skills concerning technology and engineering can help students save money and make their life more convenient. To explain it further, students who select engineering classes learn a lot about the mechanics of many machines and devices. With the knowledge about digital devices, they know better how to lengthen the life-span of them. Moreover, when their screen-based devices are malfunctioning, they are capable of repairing them by themselves and don’t have to buy new ones or pay repairing fees. In accordance to a research conducted by John Hopkins University, students who take at least a course in computer science are 47.29% percent more likely than students who don't to succeed in coping with an unexpected error of their computer. ***It is utterly/abundantly/unmistakably/crytal clear that*** technological skills are tremendously useful in students’ everyday life.

   >When it comes to ameliorating the standard of dormitory life, some people deem that making the dormitory room a study place with no noise or distraction is the best way, while other people reckon that the dorm room should be a place of recreation and enjoyment. However, from my perspective, establishing the room as a mini gym is optimal.
   3. 主要观点
   >Building a little gym inside the dorm room is tremendously beneficial to our health and well-being. With regard to physical health, students can do aerobics in the fitness room after staying sedentary for the whole day. These exercises will help ease their neck pain and burn plenty of calories, preventing them from gaining excessive weight. Consequently, the risks of weight-related diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, will be considerably reduced. Enough exercise is instrumental to better blood circulation, so working out in the dormitory gym might also prevent cardiovascular diseases. Regarding mental health, doing enjoyable exercises triggers the release of endorphin. Also, the mini gym provides students with a temporary escape from their drab and dreary daily routine, so it’s not hard to believe that all the inhabitants will fall in love with the dormitory fitness room. This point is best illustrated by the case of my roommate, Ron. He used to be stuck in his hectic schedule, which is stuffed with tiring math and computer science classes, when he came back to our dormitory, the only thing in his mind was to eat his comfort food, which is all kinds of chocolate and cheese biscuits. After one year in college, he gained 40 pounds and suffered from obesity. And this wrought havoc on his confidence because he was teased by many classmates just for his body shape. But the next year we built a mini fitness centre in our dormitory and when we finished our classes in the evening, we would do pull ups together and compete with each other. We ran on the treadmills together, conversing about our daily life and sharing interesting moments, and the time spent in the mini gym took the stressful things off our mind. After one year, Ron’s body shape was dramatically improved, and he began to enjoy a healthy life and a positive mindset. The relationship between us, with no doubt, was better than ever.
   1. 两个次要观点       
   Admittedly, establishing a quiet study in the dormitory brings numerous benefits. To explain it further. It enables inhabitants to build together an atmosphere to spend as much time as possible studying, and thus help them achieve academic excellence. However, cafes and libraries, with more space, are better places to study. According to a research conducted by Yale Universtiy, 74.29 percent of students in college prefer studying in school libraries rather than in their dorm rooms. So it is crystal clear that building a place to study inside the dorm is a waste of time and effort.     
   Granted, building a recreation room in the dormitory enables students to free themselves temporarily from the stress of school work. When they get to, say, see a film when they are exhausted after devoting the whole day to endless courses, they can become totally relaxed and be better prepared for the tight schedule awaiting them the next day.By contrast, a recreation room in the dormitory might well become a source of noise in the dormitory, which is supposed to be a place of good rest. Other students might be bothered, and conflicts may occur between roomates. Hence, a building an entertainment room is not sensible.

   4. 中间段第一段
      1. 试写：Firstly, fast technological advance makes it possible for people to prevent serious diseases and receive better treatment than(***compared with***) decades ago. To be more specific, nowadays vitamin pills and other health maintaining products are perfectly available to the vast majority, while people weren’t able to get these products a few generations ago. Some people even died because of the lack of certain minerals and nutrients, which are abundant in these commodities. Also, cutting-edge technology has found out methods to treat various diseases that were fatal before, such as cardiovascular diseases. However, some operations were impossible previously, and a great number of people died in desperation. Moreover, the great speed of vehicles enables patients to be treated timely. This point is best illustrated by the case of my family. When my grandfather worked in the factory decades ago, his finger was cut off by the machine he operated, when he was sent to the hospital by a tricycle, it was already too late to conducted the operation and he lost his finger forever. And last year my uncle, a watch repairer was accidentally entailed in a violent incident, his hand was severed by the criminal. Thanks to the speed of the ambulance, his hand was attached back. He can continue to repair complex watches just like before. ***Hence/thus/therefore***, it’s ***crystal/utterly/abundantly*** clear that technology plays an important role in helping people stay healthy./***It reinforces my point that***
      2. 老师补充：In the past,... be confronted with diseases --- outdated knowledge ---wrong therapy ---poor health; however, more precise --- more effective --- health
   5. Secondly, government also contributes more and more to improving peoples’ fitness. To be more specific, municipal governments have done a lot to publicize knowledge on healthy lifestyles, such as holding lectures in community centers and offering free compulsory class which offers great opportunities for students to learn about how to eat better and lead a healthy lifestyle. However, people in the past didn’t have access to such lectures or classes. Governments use there fiscal revenue to cover the expense of health insurance for citizens, so many treatments which were too expensive for poverty-stricken people are now affordable. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that government benefits are instrumental to improving people’s health conditions.
   Thirdly, conceptual change also plays an important role in enhancing peoples physical conditions. People in China used to eat meals that were made for a long time, even when they had gone bad. Those rotten food wreak havoc on their health conditions, and many poor people at that time suffer from diseases concerning their digestive system. But in modern times young people insist on throwing away expired food, and talk elderly people into doing it. According to a research conducted by Renming University of China, the possibility of diseases connect to rotten food has gone down for 47.29 percent in the past 60 years. Therefore, it reinforces my point that conceptual change contributes to the improvement of the public’s health.
