7. 提问：分为左右两栏：p和s
8. 对比：vs
9. 重读/阴阳怪调（奇怪的音调）：很可能出重听题

1. tpo43 agnostids' way of living（古生物类，难点是时态不能搞错，尤其是might have done）
   1. The reading and listening material have a debate on agnostids’ ways of living. The author states three possible theories but each of them are contradicted by the following lecturer.
   Firstly, the writer claims that agnostids might *have been*() free-swimming hunters living on smaller animals, while the speaker views this issue from an opposite angel. According to her, predators hunting for prey(不可数) in open sea areas typically have large and well-developed eyes, because good vision is very important in the hunting process(*because good vision is necessary to track their prey*,信息不准确). However, agnostids had little and poorly-developed eyes,*sometimes they are even completely blind*(漏信息). They are not likely free-swimming hunters unless they have special sensory organs *helping to chase after their prey*, but fossil records provide no evidence for existence of such organs.
   Secondly, the author believes that agnostids might *have been*（注意时态）dwellers on the seafloor. However, the lecturer opposes the writer’s opinion by saying that agnostids are too fast to be seafloor dwellers. It’s typical of seafloor dwellers to move slowly in localized areas and not spreading far away. Dwellers of a certain species are likely to occupy one small geographical area where they originated. But agnostids had multiple habitats in different geographical areas and were widely spread, indicating their ability to move fast and spread across large distances.
   seafloor dwellers usually move slowly across the seafloor. They tend to stay in localized areas rather than spread to new areas. It is often the case that each species of
   Third, the passage claims that agnostids were probably parasitic animals. By contrast, in accordance with the professor, this theory does not hold water because the great size of agnostid populations. A typical characteristic of parasitic species is that their populations are usually small. If they proliferated in large amounts, their host organisms will be killed off. Conversely, large amounts of fossilized agnostids of different types are found. The great sizes of their populations rule out the possibility of the parasite hypothesis.
