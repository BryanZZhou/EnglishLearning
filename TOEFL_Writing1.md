## 绝对词题
1. 特征词：best only never always all must most 形容词最高级
2. 绝对词题一般写驳论比较好写（相对于立论）（证明不是最好比证明最好更加容易）
3. 方法论：第一段先承认合理性（体现全面性），但是不是最好的；第二段指出缺点；第三段针对绝对词反驳，例如best找出更好的，most就找more，看到always/all/never就找exception，看到only/must就找other。正好三段。
4. 篇幅分配：应该是第一段最短（因为和自己的总观点相悖），第二段和第三段哪个长都可以，其中有一段必须要有一个例子，而且例子可以很长的，百余字。
5. 第一段转折：However, to say + 题干改写 + is an overstatement
6. 例证
   1. 个例： 
      1. Take somebody for example.
      2. Taking ... for example,... 
      3. Somebody is a good case in point
      4. This point is best illustrated by the case of ...(somebody,somebody's experience/effort to...)
   2. 多例(个例字数不够的时候就用多例)

   3. 数例:According to the survey/research conducted by xx University in 2018

   1. para1

      2. 有论点就必须有论据,所以要展开
         1. prevent the mistakes made in the past(World War II)

         3. Broaden one's horizons
         4. be instrumental in 起到关键作用

            1. take class = attend class = enroll in = sign up for = have = join
      3. Admittedly, the benefits of joining history courses are manifold. As William Shakespeare put it, "what's past is prologue". Students(人称指代都用第三人称,不要用We) can surely learn from the history experience to prevent the mistakes made in the past, such as World War II(展开比罗列更加重要).However,to say that students of every major should enroll in history classes is an overstatement.
   2. para2

      4. Forcing every student into history classes may well wreak havoc on their academic performance. Taking students majoring in STEM majors as a case(后面不能加in point 了,否则是杂糅), they already have extremely hectic schedules, running between class buildings and laboratories every single day. They have to beat their brains out to complete their homework and prepare formal presentations about their science project frequently. Adding history classes to their course list will definitely wear out their enthusiasm and make them counterproductive, leading to worse overall academic performance. This point is best illustrated by the example of my roommate, he is forced to take an extra history class while having to attend 13 classes on nuclear physics. Every day he wakes up before the sun rises and come back to the dormitory after midnight. He can’t help dozing off during classes and therefore have to make up after class. This vicious circle makes him exhausted and unable to concentrate, and he is inevitably in poor physical conditions and getting lower scores in tests and exams.
   3. para3
      1. Students majoring in sciences and engineering
      2. History classed should not be compulsory to all the students of sciences and engineering. Tsinghua University is a good case in point. Tsinghua University is devoted in nurturing STEM talents, which is lacking in history professors. It will undoubtedly impose an extra financial burden if it has to provide history classes to the huge amount of students of sciences and engineering, because the education quality cannot be ensured unless the University hire numerous high-paying talents in History. The financial burden will probably be reflected in student’s tuition, and that may cause widespread complaints.
